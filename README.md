## 1. Getting Started 🚦

### The Very Beginning

Make sure Git is installed on your machine:

```bash
# Check if Git is installed
git --version
# Output: git version 2.x.x
```
*First things first - make sure Git is ready to rock!*

### Creating Your First Repository
```bash
# Initialize a new repository
git init
# This Creates .git folder - the magic happens here! 
```

### Essential First Steps
```bash
# Check what's happening (always a good idea!)
git status
# Output: On branch master (or main)
#         No commits yet
#         nothing to commit
```

## The Complete Workflow

### Real-World Scenario: Starting a New Project

#### Step 1: Initialize and Connect
```bash
# Start your local repository
git init

# Add your remote repository (where your code will live online)
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/your-repo.git

# Check your remote is set up correctly
git remote -v
# origin  https://github.com/username/your-repo.git (fetch)
# origin  https://github.com/username/your-repo.git (push)
```

#### Step 2: The Great Branch Migration (Master → Main)
```bash
# If you're on 'master' and want to switch to 'main'
git branch -M main
# This renames your current branch to 'main'

# Or create main branch if it doesn't exist
git checkout -b main
```
*Modern Git uses 'main' as the default branch name!*
